The Slava, also called Krsna Slava and Krsno ime,
 is a Serbian Orthodox church tradition of the ritual glorification of
 one's family's patron saint among Serbs, but also Montenegrins and Macedonians.
 The family celebrates the Slava annually on the saint's feast day.
 The Slava is most associated with the Serbs and Montenegrins,
 who consider it a national tradition.
 They are most conscientious in its observation and
 regard the Slava as their most significant feast days.
 The tradition of the slava is also preserved among the Serbian diaspora.
 The Slava is also recorded among other ethnic groups.
